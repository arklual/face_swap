# Memory Bank

This directory is the single source of truth for long-term project memory.

Structure:

- `context.md` — current working state (no history)
- `architecture.md` — current architecture overview (no decisions/history)
- `problems.md` — known issues and limitations
- `decisions/` — immutable decision records (append-only files)
- `progress/` — multi-step task tracking
- `research/` — exploration notes and discoveries (no decisions)
